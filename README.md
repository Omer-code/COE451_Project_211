COE-451 Term Project

This is step by step demonstration for phase one of COE-451 term project.

Project Description:
Build a client-server file transfer application using any programming language of your choice. The
application must use TCP as a transport layer to ensure reliability. The client application must
continuously provide the user with a command prompt allowing the user to select between 3 commands;
GET, PUT, and QUIT. The GET command (syntax: GET filename) retrieves a copy of a specified file
from the server side. The PUT command (syntax: PUT filename) places a copy of a specified file from the
client side on the server side. Once a GET command or a PUT command has been executed, the command
prompt should be provided back to the user. If the user issues a QUIT command, then the client
application should close the TCP connection and terminate the client application.

* Requirements to run the project:
1. Python.
2. Python Socket package.
3. Python OS package.
4. Preferably a virtual machine for testing.
5. When sending files from the server or client, make sure the files are located in the workplace of your project.
